TODO List
By: Anzu
==========
Fix:
-Namalsk Map (regen tiles?  total tile image may be too small) (also, need to tweak JS in namalskmap.php)
-dashboard playerlist for delta server (sometimes the list disappears after refreshing once?)
-Need to test (and maybe fix) Ban/Kick/Delete player buttons in the table rows
-add local log file support for other servers (add to DayZ_Servers PHP class)
-Replace any remaining mysql_ functions with PDO equivalents

Add:
-cleanup hive options, database admin page
-Add Ban/Kick/Msg player to playerlist rows on dashboard
-Add columns to dashboard tables to show:
  -players profile start time
	-Z-coord
	-total deaths/kills/murders/etc
-Scripts log notifier (notify on abnormal scripts logged, maybe something similar to Item Check page?)
-kool features :)

Larger Projects:
-bans database (add/remove/search/sync bans.txt on separate servers from one web interface)
-multi-tiered admin pages
	-certain admins only able to edit their own gear
	-page for regular players to search stats, etc
-AWG HIVE stats page for main website (most-wanted, oldest, most humanity,etc)
-an EFFICIENT web-based AJAX log streamer
