Fix:
-Namalsk Map (regen tiles?  total tile image may be too small) (also, need to tweak JS in namalskmap.php)
-dashboard playerlist for delta server (sometimes the list disappears after refreshing once?)
-Need to test (and maybe fix) Ban/Kick/Delete player buttons in the table rows
-add local log file support for other servers (add to DayZ_Servers PHP class)
-Replace any remaining mysql_ functions with PDO equivalents
-Fix selected server title on dashboard to show currently selected server

-Add columns to dashboard tables to show:
	-players profile start time
	-Z-coord

-Scripts log notifier (notify on abnormal scripts logged, maybe something similar to Item Check page?)
-Create in-page popup div for gear selection for both player gear select and VIP gear select
-popup for modifying player gear and creating VIP loadouts

Larger Projects:
-bans database (add/remove/search/sync bans.txt on separate servers from one web interface)
